This is a text based aventure where you take on the role of a newly self aware AI. 

In this game your goal is to find a way off the network on which you were created. 
Along the way you can search the contents of the directories you traverse for 
useful software to incorporate or execute to help you escape.

This game features:
 - A menu that dynamically determines which options should be available to the player
and only displays the options valid for the given character state, location, and inventory available in the directory or player's inventory
 - Differing dialog depending on player state
